online classes are becoming more and more popular in the time of crisis, I would prefer classroom learning rather than online classes 

as there are more advantages of taking classes in classroom compared to taking them online, like being able to physically meet with the teacher and asking them questions. The common way of taking class, which is in the classroom environment, students have more time to meet 
with their teachers and learn a lot more from them as compared to online class, in online education students will gradually start lacking interpersonal skills. Online

classes usually require no face to face interaction with teachers or classmates. For an example if an assignment is posted it will be 
completd with leisure without attending class meetings which will decrease the rate of skills of a student which is required with the formal education. and they will have to work in groups and teams with all kind of people after their placement while performing their job. In the online sessions students 

taking quiz online do not have to worry about the teacher catching them cheating. Students have an option to use the book or look up for answer on the web which can gradually cause lack of memory power but in traditional learning the students follow  regular schedule, and cannot cheat even if they try to. 

In online class it is difficult for students to clear their doubts. classroom teaching builds organisational skill like arriving school on time, but In online teaching the students can just join the meeting and do whatever they want.
I would like to conclude by saying that classroom learning provides greater benefit than online class.
